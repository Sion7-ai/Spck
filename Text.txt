[Intro, dark bassline + moody guitar echoes]
(whispered) yeah... crown's cracked... uh-huh...

[Verse 1, melodic vocals, dark and moody]
Woke up bleeding silver lies  
City kings wear cheap disguise  
Paper castles built from pain  
Every dream I chased in vain  

Rusty halos, hollow thrones  
Whispers cut through skin and bones  
Promises fade without a sound  
Heavy lies my broken crown  

[Pre-Chorus, building tension, distorted guitars rising]
(Tension rising)  
I'm holding tight, I’m slipping slow  
Thorns cut deep, nowhere to go  

[Chorus, explosive rock chorus, layered vocals]
[Drop – brief silence, powerful band entry]  
Broken crown, fall from my head (fall!)  
Kings and clowns, they're all misled (misled!)  
Blood runs cold through empty towns (empty towns!)  
Watch me burn my broken crown (burn it down!)

[Post-Chorus, dark echoes]
(burn it down, down, down...)

[Verse 2,  Rap feature, fast-paced, aggressive flow]
[Beat intensifies, hip-hop groove layered in]  
Yo,  
I'm sick of these jokers in fake velvet robes  
Promises crack like a punch to the nose  
Built me a kingdom on pillars of lies  
Now it collapses, I'm buried alive  
I've swallowed their poison, I drank their deceit  
But trust me, revenge tastes bitter and sweet  
Been dragged through the mud, now I'm dragging 'em down  
I spit out these flames as I'm torching the crown  
Sick of pretending, these smiles are a mask  
Ripping them off, yo, I'm up to the task  
I shattered illusions, the castle's on fire  
Burning these bridges, I'm climbing up higher  
You wanted a monster, you're getting him now  
The king of the ashes, I’m flipping the crown!

[Pre-Chorus, melodic return, emotionally charged]
(Guitars and drums rise back up)  
I'm holding tight, I’m slipping slow  
Thorns cut deep, nowhere to go  

[Chorus, explosive, powerful vocals]
[Drop – band hits heavy]  
Broken crown, fall from my head (fall!)  
Kings and clowns, they're all misled (misled!)  
Blood runs cold through empty towns (empty towns!)  
Watch me burn my broken crown (burn it down!)

[Bridge, slow dramatic breakdown, bass-driven]
(Whispered vocals)  
I've seen it all crumble, I've tasted the dust  
I fought for the shine but it's eaten by rust  

[Build-up, shouted, intense vocal]
Now watch me rise—  
Yeah, watch me rise!

[Chorus, final explosive round, rap adlibs echoing]
[Drop – massive final entry]  
Broken crown, fall from my head (fall!)  
Kings and clowns, they're all misled (misled!)  
Blood runs cold through empty towns (empty towns!)  
Watch me burn my broken crown (burn it down!)

[Outro, haunting fade-out, rap adlibs fading]
(let it burn, let it burn...)  
(crown’s cracked, never coming back...)
