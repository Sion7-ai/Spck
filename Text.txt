[Intro, Locker und treibend]
[Bass-Picking, leichte Gitarrenslides]

[Verse 1]
Bicycle wheels on dusty streets  
Cracked sidewalks hum under my feet  
Painted dreams on brickwall skins  
Moonlight bleeding through broken inns  

Neon bugs in the parking lot  
Old man Joe's still smoking pot  
I’m counting cracks in my own cage  
A small-town bird in a rusted age  

[Pre-Chorus, Aufgeladen, leicht melancholisch]
[Handclaps, gedämpfte Chöre im Hintergrund]  
I twist, I shake, I fake a grin  
Still I’m stuck beneath my skin  

[Chorus]
I'm riding nowhere, fast and blind  
Small town cage inside my mind  
Clipped my wings before I knew  
Sky was always bleeding through  

[Verse 2]
Lemonade stands and dead-end jobs  
Streetlight fights and half-heard sobs  
I’m building maps out of old postcards  
Dreaming highways in old junkyards  

Late night radio spins my name  
Lost in static, lost in flame  
Every whisper, every stage  
Leads me out this tiny cage  

[Pre-Chorus]
I twist, I shake, I fake a grin  
Still I’m stuck beneath my skin  

[Chorus]
I'm riding nowhere, fast and blind  
Small town cage inside my mind  
Clipped my wings before I knew  
Sky was always bleeding through  

[Bridge, Verträumt, bittersüß]
[Instrumental Break mit funky Solo]  
[Whispered]  
Fences break where dreams collide  
Rust and love on every side  

[Chorus]
I'm riding nowhere, fast and blind  
Small town cage inside my mind  
Clipped my wings before I knew  
Sky was always bleeding through  

[Outro, Locker, aber aufbrechend]
[Gitarren und Bass grooven aus, Miles lacht leise]
